=======================================
Transition Guide for Change in Features
=======================================

In addition to the quality improvements,  some new features were added, and some features were deprecated to improve user experience. For any questions, please reach out to the cuOpt team through github issues.

Parameter/option statuses used in this guide mean the following:

  **New** - A new feature has been added.

  **Update** - A change in definition of feature.

  **Deprecated** - These options will be accepted but will be removed in the future. In the case of the cuOpt service, the server will also return a warning noting that a feature is deprecated.

  **Limited** - These options are limited with respect to the number of dimensions that can be provided.

  **Removed** - These features were deprecated in a previous release and completely removed in this one.

Release 26.04
--------------

- **LP/MILP self-hosted REST:** The canonical parameter list and semantics are in :doc:`lp-qp-milp-settings`. The :doc:`open-api` schema is intentionally non-exhaustive for ``solver_config``; pass-through keys use the same snake_case names as in the user guide. The **Historical** sections below (25.05 alignment) document older service field renames for clients upgrading saved requests.

Historical: self-hosted service ``solver_configs.tolerances`` (25.05 alignment)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following fields are **Deprecated** in ``solver_configs.tolerances`` for the service:

- absolute_primal
- absolute_dual
- absolute_gap
- relative_primal
- relative_dual
- relative_gap
- primal_infeasible
- dual_infeasible
- integrality_tolerance
- absolute_mip_gap
- relative_mip_gap

The following fields are **New** in ``solver_configs.tolerances`` for the service and replace the deprecated fields above:

- absolute_primal_tolerance
- absolute_dual_tolerance
- absolute_gap_tolerance
- relative_primal_tolerance
- relative_dual_tolerance
- relative_gap_tolerance
- primal_infeasible_tolerance
- dual_infeasible_tolerance
- mip_integrality_tolerance
- mip_absolute_gap
- mip_relative_gap

The following fields are **New** in ``solver_configs.tolerances`` for the service but were available in the C API in 25.05

- mip_absolute_tolerance
- mip_relative_tolerance

Historical: self-hosted service ``solver_configs`` top-level fields (25.05 alignment)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following fields are **Deprecated** in ``solver_configs`` for the service:

- solver_mode
- heuristics_only

The following fields are **New** in ``solver_configs`` for the service and replace the deprecated fields above:

- pdlp_solver_mode
- mip_heuristics_only

The following are **New** in ``solver_configs`` for the service but were available in the C API in 25.05

- strict_infeasibility
- user_problem_file
- per_constraint_residual
- save_best_primal_so_far
- first_primal_feasible
- log_file
- solution_file
