/**
 * @file data_model_view.hpp
 * @brief Provides data_model_view_t in the cuopt::linear_programming namespace.
 *
 * This header provides access to the data_model_view_t class, a non-owning view
 * over LP/MIP problem data. The view uses span<T> to hold pointers that can
 * reference either host or device memory, making it suitable for both local
 * GPU-based solves and remote CPU-based solves.
 *
 * The canonical implementation lives in cuopt::mps_parser for historical reasons
 * and to maintain mps_parser as a standalone library. This header provides
 * convenient aliases in the cuopt::linear_programming namespace.

 *
 * Key features for remote solve support:
 * - Non-owning: does not allocate or free memory
 * - Memory-agnostic: spans can point to host OR device memory
 * - Serializable: host data can be directly serialized for remote solve
 *
 * @tparam i_t Integer type for indices (typically int)
 * @tparam f_t Floating point type for values (typically float or double)
